* distinctfd goal behaved badly if argument wasn't ground
* LOGIC-62: distincto bug reveals much larger issues around how we look up constraints.
  because vars can be bound in any order and we use vars to map to constraints in the
  store we need a stable root var. constrained vars are now added as ::unbound in the
  substitution map. This information is used to know if a var is a root.
